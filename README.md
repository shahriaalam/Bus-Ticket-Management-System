INTRODUCTION OF BUS RESERVATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
1) Project Abstract: The bus reservation management application presented here is a very simple console application developed using java
   swing. It has been compiled using IDE Intelligence and NetBeans. We used file to store data to make this program memory efficient.

2) Feature: As an admin, you can see the total booking, total sales of tickets, and the bus list using this application. As a buyer, one can book his
   tickets and after booking, he/she can also cancel his/her tickets. Users also can see his/her total Ticket price list. While booking, the user can also
   choose his/her favorite destination and number of tickets. After booking tickets, one can see the total payment slip.

3) Working: At first admin needs to login into this program using a password to get admin panel access. Admin can see the total booking, total
   sales of tickets, and the bus list using this application. After the cancelation of tickets, the total amount is deducted from the total price of selling tickets.
   Then the user also needs to sign up first then login into this program to get access of user panel. Users can also see the ticket price and choose his/her
   favorite destination and number of tickets. After booking tickets, a payment slip will be shown to the user.

4) Future update: In future, we will try to add the journey date and time.
